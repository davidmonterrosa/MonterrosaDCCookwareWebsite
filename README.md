### Description:

- Responsives for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile Version via figma 
- Use of CSS systems and Framework for responsiveness - Grid, Flexbox and BootStrap
- Use the following for at least one section of cards: Flex box, CSS Grid and bootstrap. For the flex box and grid sections there should be no bootstrap classes used.
- No use of the bootstrap "card" class - IE creating your own cards  
- Use CSS systems to style site are you use but must use each one at least one .
